{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"1,600\"}\n```\n\nThe output should be a JSON instance that conforms to the schema:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"1,600\"}\n```\n\nThe error is with the object, \"answer\" has only one key \"answer\" with value \"1600\", hence the output json has only  one key value pair in it.\nThe output json should have one more key-value pair which is required for the schema.\nSo the json should be:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"1,600\", \"error\": \"wrong format\"}\n```\nOr\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"1,600\", \"description\": \"wrong format\"}\n```"}
