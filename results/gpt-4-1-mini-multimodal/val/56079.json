{"answer":"INTRODUCTION\nThe development of smoking machines has taken place over perhaps 45 years. However because the mechanical configurations which can meet this Recommended Method differ greatly, it has been found from the work of a special Task Force*, established by CORESTA, that additional specification of the immediate smoking machine environment is necessary. This leads to better reproducibility in the international inter-laboratory comparisons which are often required. It is doubtful if a general mechanical specification can be written to cover all types of smoking machine and so, as well as a general specification, it is necessary to provide examples for the designs most generally used."}
