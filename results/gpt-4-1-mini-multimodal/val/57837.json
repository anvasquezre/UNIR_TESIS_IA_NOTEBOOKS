{"answer":"c. Subsidiary Company\nDuring the financial year 1998-1999, your Company's subsidiary had received financial assets worth ₹1200 lakhs against a future liability of ₹5200 lakhs. This was settled on 31st March, 1999 for an immediate payment of ₹1250 lakhs. The settlement was not accepted during the assessment proceedings and accordingly disallowed by the Income Tax Authorities. An appeal before the CIT(A), the matter was held in favour of your Company's subsidiary. However, the Income Tax Tribunal while holding the matter against your Company's subsidiary held that the ratification of the said settlement agreement by the Board did not relate to 31st March, 1999 and therefore not allowable as a deduction for the year. The tax liability on this is ₹240 lakhs apart from interest. Your Company's subsidiary preferred an appeal against the above order before the Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh."}
