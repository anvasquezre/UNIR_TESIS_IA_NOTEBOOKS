{"answer":"C. Public input at pre-prioritization step\n\nEPA requests comment on whether and how EPA should solicit additional input at the pre-prioritization phase.\" Response: It is not only appropriate, but well advised for EPA to solicit public input at each stage of the prioritization process. From a \"data quality\" perspective it is important for the public to have the opportunity to comment on the data/information that EPA believes is relevant to prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation. As discussed in our comments above, ACC believes EPA must take a sequenced, step-wise approach to gathering available information and/or developing new information in the pre- prioritization stage. It makes sense for EPA to first gather reasonably available information, then solicit public input to identify additional data/information from stakeholders, on a voluntary basis. Then EPA should use reporting tools under Section 8 for additional existing information if needed. Only after using these approaches should the Agency consider ordering the development of new information for prioritization purposes, subject to the requirements of LCSA Section 4."}
