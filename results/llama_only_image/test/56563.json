{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the total number of \"Saturday Sunday Vacation\", we need to add up all the values in that column.\n\nThe values are:\n\n* 2 (February 1-2)\n* 2 (February 21-26)\n* 3 (February 18-19)\n* 6 (February 26-27)\n* 2 (February 16)\n* 1 (February 17)\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n2 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 16\n\nHowever, the table shows a total of 17 Saturday-Sunday vacations, which contradicts our calculation. It's likely that the total is actually the sum of the days worked outside N.Y. (which is 17) rather than the number of \"Saturday-Sunday Vacation\". Therefore, the answer is 0, since the total number of \"Saturday-Sunday Vacation\" is not explicitly stated and cannot be verified.\n\nAnswer: 0"}
