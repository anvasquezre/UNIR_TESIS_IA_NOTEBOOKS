{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The answer is that there was no response from Michael Dourson; this is because the question is based on an excerpt from a document, which only shows the page labeled 'vol. 12 - 22'. The pages before and after that one are not included in the snippet, so it's impossible to know for sure whether Dr. Dourson responded or not."}
