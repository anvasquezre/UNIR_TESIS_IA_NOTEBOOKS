{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Answer:**\n\nThe second total shown is **120.00 T**.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. The image provided appears to be a receipt or invoice with a column titled \"Total\" at the top.\n2. Below this, there are two columns of numbers: one with values in dollars and cents (e.g., 3.00, 1.00) and another with values in hundreds of dollars (e.g., 25.00, 20.00).\n3. The first total, marked as \".00 T\", seems to be the sum of the dollar and cent values.\n4. The second total, marked as \"120.00 T\", is likely calculated from the hundreds of dollar values listed below.\n5. Given the format and layout, it's reasonable to assume that the second total represents the total cost or sum of all items purchased, possibly before any discounts or tax.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe second total shown is indeed **120.00 T**, indicating the aggregate amount of the items purchased before any potential deductions or fees."}
