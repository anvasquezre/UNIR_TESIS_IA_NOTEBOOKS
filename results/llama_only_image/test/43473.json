{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Full Form of LIBOR**\n\nThe full form of LIBOR is **London Interbank Offered Rate**, which is also referred to as the **London Interbank Overnight Rate (LIBOR)** or **USD LIBOR**. It is a benchmark interest rate at which major global banks offer loans to each other and serves as a widely accepted measure of the average interest rate at which interbank lending takes place.\n\n**Key Characteristics**\n\n*   **Definition**: The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) represents the interest rate that banks with high creditworthiness in the London interbank market would be expected to pay on their borrowings from other such banks, provided in four major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY) and in six major maturities (overnight, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) on a given day.\n*   **Importance**: The rate is used as a basis for pricing derivatives such as interest rate swaps, options, forwards, and futures. It serves as a reference rate in the setting of contracts and it is the main factor for many types of adjustable rate loans that are based on a floating rate such as adjustable rate mortgages and credit card rates.\n*   **Limitations**: Despite its popularity and widespread use as a benchmark for calculating interest rates, the LIBOR has been under scrutiny for years over allegations of manipulation. In 2020, the United States banned the use of the LIBOR rate for most new contracts because regulators concluded that it is not a reliable benchmark for measuring lending costs.\n\nIn summary, the LIBOR is a widely recognized standard reference interest rate that represents the average cost that the banks would be charged in the market for borrowing to other banks for various loan periods."}
