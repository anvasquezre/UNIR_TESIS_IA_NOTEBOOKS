{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Point number 7 in the document is \"Hydrogenation.\" It states that a chemical process called hydrogenation lowers the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. This makes them more stable at room temperature and harder at room temperature. These oils then resemble saturated fat.\n\nIt's worth noting that while hydrogenation has changed the properties of vegetable oils, it doesn't necessarily mean they are healthier options. In fact, many experts recommend avoiding processed foods with partially hydrogenated oils due to concerns about their impact on heart health. Instead, opt for unprocessed oils like olive oil or avocado oil, which are rich in unsaturated fats and considered healthier choices."}
