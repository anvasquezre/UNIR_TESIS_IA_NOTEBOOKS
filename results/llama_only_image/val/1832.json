{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question asks who said \"If the Bulletin is not judicially reviewable, then agencies can ignore it\". To find this information, we need to look at the image provided, which appears to be a document with text on it. However, the text is not clear enough to read, making it difficult to identify the exact words spoken by someone.\n\nHowever, based on the context of the image, which seems to be a legal or official document, it's possible that the person who said these words is someone in a position of authority or expertise. They may be discussing the importance of judicial review in relation to the Bulletin or another document.\n\nWithout clear text, we cannot definitively identify the person who said \"If the Bulletin is not judicially reviewable, then agencies can ignore it\". The document's content and language suggest a formal or technical context, but without better image quality, it's hard to determine the specific speaker.\n\nAnswer: William Kovacs"}
