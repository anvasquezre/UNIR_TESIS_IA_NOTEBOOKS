{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the answer, we need to look at the table and find the amino acid that shows an increase in T.A.\n\nThe table shows the effects of different amino acids on urinary electrolyte excretion. We can see that there are arrows pointing up or down next to each amino acid, indicating whether it increases or decreases the T.A.\n\nLooking at the arrows, we can see that:\n\n* Glutamic Acid does not have an effect on T.A.\n* Aspartic Acid does not have an effect on T.A.\n* Arginine increases T.A.\n* Arginine-HCl does not have an effect on T.A.\n* Arginine-Glutamate does not have an effect on T.A.\n* Lysine does not have an effect on T.A.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is Arginine."}
