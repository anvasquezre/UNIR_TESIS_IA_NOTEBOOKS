{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the percentage of female respondents who use sugar only with beverages, we need to subtract the percentage of respondents who answered \"yes\" from the total percentage of female respondents. According to the image, 72% of the women surveyed reported using sugar with both food and beverages. Since the question specifically asks about using sugar \"only with foods other than beverages\", we can assume that the remaining percentage is made up of respondents who do not use sugar at all or only use it with beverages.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of female respondents who use sugar only with beverages is 72%."}
