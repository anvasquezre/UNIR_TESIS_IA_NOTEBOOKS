{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"There is not enough information present in the image to provide a response to the question. The color of the form cannot be determined from the given image. The image provided is a black and white copy of a form that includes several sections such as a header, claimant information, diagnosis, and doctor's statement. There is a table titled \"Claimant's Statement\" that asks the claimant for information like name, date of first claim, physician's name, and whether disability is due to injury or how often it occurred. There are several other tables related to the job, compensation, and other information, as well as an area to sign the claim and mail it. \n\nIt should be noted that the form includes several blank boxes that could potentially indicate a different color for the actual form, but this cannot be confirmed by looking at the black and white image."}
