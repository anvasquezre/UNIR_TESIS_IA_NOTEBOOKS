{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question requires us to identify the exhibit number for the Doctor's resume. In the transcript provided, there is no direct reference to a specific exhibit number for the Doctor's resume. Instead, the transcript mentions that the Doctor was handed a marked exhibit. Without further context or details from the exhibit, it's challenging to provide a clear and accurate answer to the question about the exhibit number.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the transcript, it can be inferred that the Doctor's resume may be connected to Exhibit D2455, but without additional information, we cannot definitively identify the correct exhibit number."}
