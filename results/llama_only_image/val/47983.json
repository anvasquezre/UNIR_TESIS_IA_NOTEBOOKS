{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Solution: Identifying the Alcohol Use Group with the Lowest 'n'**\n\nTo determine the alcohol use group with the lowest 'n', we need to examine the provided data in Table G, which presents the distribution of hospitalizations from the date of check-up to December 1976 among various alcohol use groups. The table provides the number of hospitalizations and the mean number of hospitalizations for each group.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Table**\n\n| Group | N | Hospitalized Once or More | Total Hospitalizations | Mean Hospitalizations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nondrinkers | 2,015 | 39.9 | 1,712 | 0.87 |\n| ≤ 2 drinks daily | 2,015 | 37.3 | 1,540 | 0.76 |\n| 3-5 drinks daily | 2,015 | 37.6 | 1,744 | 0.89 |\n| 6+ drinks daily | 2,015 | 41.3 | 1,966 | 0.98 |\n| 6-8 drinks daily | 1,245 | 40.3 | 1,163 | 0.93 |\n| 9+ drinks daily | 770 | 43.0 | 803 | 1.04 |\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Data**\n\nLooking at the data in the table, we notice that each row represents a different alcohol use group. The column 'n' indicates the total number of people in each group.\n\n*   The 'n' value for Nondrinkers is 2,015.\n*   The 'n' value for ≤ 2 drinks daily is also 2,015.\n*   The 'n' value for 3-5 drinks daily is 2,015.\n*   The 'n' value for 6+ drinks daily is 2,015.\n*   The 'n' value for 6-8 drinks daily is 1,245.\n*   The 'n' value for 9+ drinks daily is 770.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the 'n' values across all the alcohol use groups, it is clear that the group with the lowest 'n' is the 9+ drinks daily group, with a value of 770. Therefore, the alcohol use group with the lowest 'n' is indeed the **9+ drinks daily** group."}
