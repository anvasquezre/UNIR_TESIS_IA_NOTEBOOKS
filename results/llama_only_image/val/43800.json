{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question requests the number of \"total implanted\", which is a term commonly used in medical and research contexts. The given answer is not a numerical value but rather an interpretation of the context.\n\nTo provide a meaningful answer, let's analyze the given information:\n\n* The context is a review of the Pinnacle Ultamet Experience for Drs.
