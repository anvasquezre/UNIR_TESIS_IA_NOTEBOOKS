{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the answer, we need to analyze the image of the document provided. The image appears to be a table comparing lysine and threonine levels in animals. \n\nThe table shows that each group of 9 animals will be divided into 3 groups of 3 animals each, and these groups will receive the supplemented rice at three different levels in the diet for a period of 21 days. In each such assay, three groups of 6 animals each will receive three different levels of lactalbumin as the standard protein.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that there are two columns for Lysine Levels and Threonine Levels. The columns show the percentage of lysine and threonine in the diet for the animals.\n\nThe Lysine Levels column shows that there are four different percentages: 0.10%, 0.20%, 0.30%, and 0.45%. The Threonine Levels column also shows four different percentages: 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15%, and 0.20%.\n\nSince the question asks how many animals receive 0.30% of Lysine and 0.15% Threonine, we can see that the table indicates that 9 animals will receive these levels.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThere are 9 animals that receive 0.30% of Lysine and 0.15% Threonine."}
