{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Calculating the Budgeted Amount for the Second Plan**\n\nTo determine the budgeted amount for the second plan across all three time periods, we must first identify the budget allocated to each period. The budgeted amount is the same for each of the three time periods, which is $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the total budgeted amount for the second plan for all three time periods is:\n\n5,000 x 3 = 15,000\n\nThe budgeted amount on the second plan for all the 3 time periods is $15,000."}
