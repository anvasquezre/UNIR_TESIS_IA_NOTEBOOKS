{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine which calcium salt has the highest percentage of calcium, we can analyze the information provided in the table.\n\nStep 1: Identify the calcium salts listed in the table.\nStep 2: Compare the percentages of calcium for each salt.\nStep 3: Determine which salt has the highest percentage of calcium.\n\nFrom the table, the calcium salts listed are:\n\n*   Calcium carbonate (40% calcium)\n*   Calcium gluconate (9% calcium)\n*   Calcium lactate (13% calcium)\n*   Calcium gluconate (6.5% calcium)\n*   Dibasic calcium phosphate (23.3% calcium)\n*   Chelated calcium (20% calcium)\n\nComparing the percentages, we find that dibasic calcium phosphate has the highest percentage of calcium at 23.3%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: Dibasic calcium phosphate."}
