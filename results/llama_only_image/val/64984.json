{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine which patient has the highest Nitrogen g/24hr, we need to examine the data presented in the graph. The graph shows the Nitrogen g/24hr values for five subjects over time.\n\nThe graph indicates that one patient (patient 5) has consistently higher Nitrogen g/24hr values compared to the other four patients. In fact, the Nitrogen g/24hr value for this patient is significantly higher than the others, especially during the second week of observation.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided in the graph, it is clear that patient 5 has the highest Nitrogen g/24hr among the five subjects.\n\n**Answer:** Patient 5"}
