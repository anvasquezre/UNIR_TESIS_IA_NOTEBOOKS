{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"According to the data, 47% of male respondents use sugar with foods other than beverages. To find the percentage that use sugar only with beverages, we can subtract this number from 100%.\n\nSo, the percentage of male respondents who use sugar only with beverages is:\n\n100% - 47% = 53%\n\nThis means that 53% of male respondents do not use sugar with beverages. However, since the question asks for the percentage of respondents who use sugar only with beverages, we need to look at the opposite of what we just calculated.\n\nThe final answer is: **53%**"}
