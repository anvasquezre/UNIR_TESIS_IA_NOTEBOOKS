{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To identify the subject with the highest pulse rate in the baseline period, we must analyze the data presented in the image. The graph illustrates the pulse rates of eleven subjects across two periods: the baseline period and the examination period.\n\n**Identifying the Highest Pulse Rate in the Baseline Period**\n\nUpon examining the graph, we find that the subject with the highest pulse rate in the baseline period is subject **5**, with a pulse rate of approximately **80 bpm**. This observation is supported by the data points plotted on the graph, which clearly indicate that subject **5** has the highest pulse rate in the baseline period.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that subject **5** had the highest pulse rate in the baseline period."}
