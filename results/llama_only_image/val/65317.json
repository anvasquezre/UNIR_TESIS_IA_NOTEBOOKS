{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Answer: 1955**\n\nReasoning Skill for Identifying Pros And Cons: Analyzing Data to Determine Trends and Patterns\n\nIn this question, we need to analyze the data provided in the image to determine which year received the least funding for family and child welfare programs. To do this, we need to compare the amounts allocated to these programs in each year.\n\nThe image shows that the amount allocated to family and child welfare programs in 1955 was $709,000, which is significantly less than the amounts allocated in the other two years ($2,196,000 in 1960 and $1,897,000 in 1960). Therefore, based on the data, it is clear that the family and child welfare programs received the least funding in 1955."}
