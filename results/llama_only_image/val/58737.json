{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Richard L. Gelb is the chairman of Bristol-Myers. According to him, the purpose of the grant is to help improve the role of nutrition not only in maintaining human health but in restoring it.\n\nIt may be said that:\n\n*   Gelb was referring to a role beyond mere nutrition that goes far beyond simply maintaining a healthy body. He is referring to the state of the brain and the state of the body, which are interdependent.\n*   If he means a healthy body and a healthy mind, then the brain and the body are the two most important parts of a person and any dysfunction of these organs has consequences in various domains of a person's life.\n*   If he refers to a state in which one is physically well and emotionally well, then the brain and the body are essential to both these domains of health. If one's mental or physical state is good, it is likely to be good overall. \n\nSo the two main functions of nutrition are:\n*   **Mental Function:** Maintaining a healthy brain. \n*   **Physical Function:** Maintaining a healthy body"}
