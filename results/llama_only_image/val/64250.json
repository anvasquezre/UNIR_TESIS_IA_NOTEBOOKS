{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Standard Deviation, represented by the acronym \"SD\" in the image, is the average distance of the elements in a set from their mean value. This provides a measure of the data set's spread, often used as an indicator of how widely dispersed a data set's elements are. The value represents how widely a series of values is spread out. For example, a smaller SD value suggests that most of the data points tend to cluster around the mean, indicating relatively consistent data points. A larger SD value, on the other hand, means that data points are more spread out and dispersed, indicating higher variance."}
