{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The image is too blurry, therefore the specific year cannot be determined. The most reliable information provided states the dose-dependent effects for Ethinyl Estradiol/NETA began in 2000, as well as the use of Transdermal E2/levonorgestrel, with a cognitive function effect noted in 2002, though this is not explicitly stated as the first year of its use.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the first treatment administered could have been as early as 2000 for Ethenyl Estradiol/NETA, or 2002 for Transdermal E2/levonorgestrel. However, the first year is unclear."}
