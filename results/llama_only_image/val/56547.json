{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The symbol * in the document indicates that the control and test groups differed significantly at the 80% confidence level. This implies a statistically significant difference between the two groups, with a p-value less than 0.01. The use of the asterisk symbol highlights the significance of this difference and emphasizes the importance of considering the findings in relation to the overall study design and methodology.\n\nThe mention of the 80% confidence level suggests that there is a high degree of certainty that the observed difference is not due to chance. In other words, it is highly unlikely that the difference between the control and test groups could be attributed to random variation.\n\nOverall, the asterisk symbol serves as a visual cue to the reader that the results have achieved statistical significance at the 80% confidence level, making it easier to interpret the findings and understand the implications for future research or practical applications."}
