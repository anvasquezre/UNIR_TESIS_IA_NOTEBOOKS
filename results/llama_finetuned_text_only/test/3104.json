{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"answer\": \"Hardness ppm is not given directly in the table; however, we can calculate it using other parameters. For calculation, the total hardness is assumed to be equivalent to the sum of calcium and magnesium in PPM. Given values are in Parts Per Million. Total hardness calculation is: (Calcium 8.77) + (Mg 1.70).\"}"}
