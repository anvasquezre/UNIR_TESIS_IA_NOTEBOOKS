{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Section 6(b)(4)(G) states that the maximum time period is three years to complete a risk evaluation (subject to a possible extension of six months), with the throughput criterion of having at least 20 risk evaluations on high-priority substances (plus up to 20 risk evaluations of manufacturer-requested chemical substances) underway by December 2019. Congress designed a statute that makes it possible for EPA to meet this throughput requirement by exercising flexibility in scoping risk evaluations, and by selecting the conditions of use targeted for review. \n\nThis shows that EPA was already considering the expansion of time to complete a risk evaluation (subject to a possible extension of six months) and to have 20 risk evaluations on high-priority substances under review. This is what the statute should be designed for to meet the throughput requirements of a risk evaluation. To further expand time and expand the conditions of a use targeted for review. By selecting the conditions for review, would require a different scope for the risk evaluation that would change its objective and how the statute should be used. So, the maximum time period to complete a risk evaluation (excluding extension) is 3 years."}
