{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The table clearly indicates \"no data\" under this column for dog serum. However, if we look at the value from \"bovine serum albumin\", which is in the same column, the value is 4.79 mg./ml. Hence, we can infer that the value of \"protein nitrogen in system\" would be similar. \n\nSo, the \"protein nitrogen in system\" from dog serum for Phosphatide could be assumed to be 4.79 mg./ml."}
