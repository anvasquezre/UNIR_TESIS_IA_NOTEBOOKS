{"answer":"","NNK levels in burley genotypes ranged from":"0.05 - 0.23 ppm in 1981 when there was no nitrogen fertilization. Their findings concluded that levels of NNK increased during each stage of homogenized-leaf-curing in the tested tobacco genotypes. NNK accumulated to a larger extent than NNN in the homogenized-leaf-cured high-alkaloid burley tobacco. NNK was significantly lower in the low-alkaloid line than in the high-alkaloid line for both the air-cured and the homogenized-leaf-cured tobaccos at each period of measurement throughout storage according to this study. \nMacKown et al, 1984, (Reference 6) postulate that fertilization with nitrogen plays a role in the amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines found in tobacco. Burley tobacco generally receives more nitrogen fertilizer unlike flue-cured tobacco. NNK levels were measured in several burley genotypes in 1981 when there was no nitrogen fertilization. The levels ranged from 0.05 -0.23 ppm. In 1982, with nitrogen fertilizer applied, the levels ranged from 0.08 - 0.71 ppm. Their findings Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/phxj0037"}
