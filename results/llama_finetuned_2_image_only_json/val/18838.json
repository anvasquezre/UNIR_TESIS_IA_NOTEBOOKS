{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"```json\n{\"answer\": \"741-2345\"} \n```\n\nNo, the problem here is not in formatting but the value of the answer. It should be formatted as a JSON object with double quotes at the beginning and end, but in this case the value of \"answer\" is missing a comma. The correct JSON should be formatted like this:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"741-2345\"}  // in the original formatting  this is not the issue, but in JSON a value without commas are usually formatted without quotes.\n```\n\nThe JSON formatting error in agent reasoning is actually because JSON does not support single quotes. It must use double quotes.\n\nThe error was not about missing comma or double quotes around \"741-2345\" in the original document, but it was about the formatting when it was outputed which needs double quotes. But here we assume that was corrected and now only the output JSON is needed.\n\nHere is the correct JSON:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"741-2345\"}\n```"}
