{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"```json\n{\n    \"sodium_is_an_essential_nutrient_in_human_physiology\": \"Sodium is an essential nutrient in human physiology. In humans, sodium helps regulate water in the body by controlling the transfer of water and other nutrients across cell membranes. It also helps maintain blood pressure and volume, transmit nerve impulses and support certain enzyme systems. The amount of sodium contributed by the local water supply is negligible when compared to many other sources of sodium in the diet. For example, a six-fluid ounce serving of tomato juice processed with added salt has 660 milligrams of sodium, while soft drinks actually contribute very little sodium. In fact, the majority of the soft drink products of Coca-cola USA have less than 35 milligrams of sodium per serving-allowing them to be classified by the Food and Drug Administration as \"very low sodium\" foods.\"\n}\n```"}
