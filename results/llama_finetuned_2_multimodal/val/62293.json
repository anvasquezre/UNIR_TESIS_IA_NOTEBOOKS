{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"\"PROGRAMA PARA LA VISITA DEL DR. ROBERT SHANK\" is the title, but it is not the name of a person. Instead, it seems to be an agenda for the visit of Dr. Robert Shank, which suggests that \"Washington University - St. Louis\" is the institution where he works. Therefore, \"PROGRAMA\" is the title, not a name. \n\nAs for the person mentioned in the title, we can see \"Dr. Robert Shank\" in the second line. So, the name of the person at the top of the page is Dr. Robert Shank."}
