{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the day of the week for February 1, 1998, we need to consider a few key factors:\n\n1. **Day of the Week Cycle**: January 1st, 1998 was a Wednesday. Understanding this allows us to predict the days of the week for the rest of the year, given that January has 31 days.\n\n2. **Days Since January 1st**: To find out what day February 1st falls on, we subtract the days leading up to January 31 from the total days from January 1st to February 1st. Since January 1st is a Wednesday, we count forward until the first day of February. The equation would look something like this, given the first month doesn't affect the calculation (January has 31 days, which we subtract from the total days in a non-leap year for simplicity):\n   - The total days in January up to the 31st are 30 (since February 1st is on the 1st).\n   - Subtracting these from the total days up to February 1st gives us 1 (the day we are interested in).\n   - Subtracting these days from a starting Wednesday gives us a Sunday.\n\nGiven these steps, February 1st, 1998 falls on a Sunday.\n\nTherefore, February 1st, 1998 was a **Sunday**."}
