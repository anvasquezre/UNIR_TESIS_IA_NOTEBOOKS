{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the highest percentage decrease in visits, we need to analyze the data provided in the image. The image shows a table with three columns: Admissions, Visits, and VNA (Total). We can see that the visits for most organizations have increased, while only a few have decreased.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we notice that the values for Admissions and Visits are actually percentages increases/decreases compared to the third quarter of 1980. This means that the numbers are not absolute changes but rather percentage changes relative to the previous period.\n\nTo find the highest percentage decrease in visits, we need to look at the negative numbers in the Visits column. However, we should be cautious not to misinterpret the values as negative percentage increases.\n\nAfter reevaluating the table, we notice that St. Louis City Hospital has a negative value for both Admissions and Visits (-3.6% and -12.3%, respectively). But, as we mentioned earlier, these values represent percentage decreases compared to the third quarter of 1980.\n\nTherefore, the highest percentage decrease in visits is indeed -12.3% for St. Louis City Hospital, indicating a decrease in the third quarter of 1981 compared to the same period in 1980.\n\nAnswer: -12.3%."}
