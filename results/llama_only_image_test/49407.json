{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"he image does not provide a specific per-day requirement for Ascorbic acid. It only provides general information about the amount of vitamin A that can be obtained from different sources.\n\nHowever, it can be inferred that a daily dose of 30 milligrams (mg) of Ascorbic acid is recommended for all ages. This is based on the fact that the document provides dosages in terms of international units (IU), which are equivalent to mg. For example, for children between 6-8 years old, the document suggests a dose of 2,500 IU, which is equivalent to 2,500 mg.\n\nTherefore, a rough estimate of the per-day requirement for Ascorbic acid could be:\n\n* For children between 6-8 years old: 2,500 mg (2,500 IU)\n* For adults: 30 mg (no specific IU equivalent provided)\n\nNote that this is just an approximation and not a precise requirement. The actual requirement may vary depending on individual factors such as age, sex, weight, and health status.\n\n*Answer*: 30 mg"}
