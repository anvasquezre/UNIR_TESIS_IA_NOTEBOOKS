{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Acidification of lakes and rivers will make them inhospitable to fish and other aquatic life. This is a result of the deposition of air pollutants, such as the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, which can lead to acidification and reduction of the productivity of the soil, vegetation damage, leaching of heavy metals, and reduced visibility. These effects are usually referred to as \"The Acid Rain Problem.\" There is considerable argument as to the chemistry of acid precipitation, its formation, transport mechanisms, and sources. However, they are a subject of public and government concern."}
