{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The first multiple-choice item described is a one-best response item that is used to assess a student's ability to select the correct answer from a series of four or five suggestions, and one correct answer plus three or four distractors. The instructor can provide a one-best response answer, one diagnosis that is best among those given.\n\nThe item may be written as a question (example 1) or as a complete statement (example 2) depending on the preference. However, the completion type stem is usually shorter than a variation of the completion type stem is the negative form (example 3). The student is asked to select the exception to the statement in the stem, in general the multiple true/false format is preferred over the negative form of completion because then the student must judge the opportunities of each alternative instead of choosing the exception."}
