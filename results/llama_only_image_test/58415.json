{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The table in this image presents data on the average daily intake and percentage of the Recommended Dietary Allowances for adult subjects. It includes various nutrients such as energy (kcal), protein (gm), vitamin A (I.U.), thiamin (mg.), riboflavin (mg.), niacin (mg.), ascorbic acid (mg.), calcium (mg.), phosphorus (mg.), iron (mg.), and energy (kcal) for both men and women in different age groups. The age groups are 19-22 years and 23-50 years for men, and 19-22 years, 23-50 years, and all subjects for women.\n\nThe answer provided, 1,203, does not match any of the data points listed in the table. To correctly determine the recommended mean daily intake of protein (gm) for a woman in the age group 23-50, we need to locate the corresponding data point in the table. The column labeled \"Women\" contains the values for women, and the row labeled \"23-50 yr\" represents the age group 23-50. However, the value listed is 34.3, which corresponds to the energy (kcal) value, not protein (gm). To find the protein (gm) value, we need to look at the other columns under \"Women\" and the row labeled \"23-50 yr\".\n\nThe correct answer can be found by locating the correct data point in the table, which is 45.2 gm.\n\nAnswer: 45.2"}
