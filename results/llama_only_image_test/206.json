{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The Shell Coal Gasification Process (SCGP) is a clean and efficient process for converting coal into synthesis gas. Synthesis gas is a versatile mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen that can be converted into many valuable products: electricity, synthetic natural gas, chemicals and liquid transportation fuels among them. SCGP is competitive for all applications because of its simple operation, its dry feed system and its generation of superheated steam in the syngas cooler which give excellent thermal efficiency."}
