{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question asks about the number of color copies that will be issued for the WOMENS'S HEALTH NEWSLETTER.\n\nAccording to the image, the newsletter will be produced on a quarterly basis with a serious clinical look. It can be mailed independently by Wyeth-Ayerst to a variety of targeted physicians, though it is recommended that representatives present it to their physicians for greatest impact.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nEach issue will be produced on a 6-8 page, 2-color issue.\n\nThe number of color copies that will be issued is not explicitly stated in the image. However, based on the description, we can infer that the newsletter will be printed in color on both the front and back sides."}
