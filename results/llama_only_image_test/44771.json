{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The result of less shear stress transmitted to the tribal tray in TC3-RP is that:\n\n*   **In RP systems, such as TC3-RP, there is less shear stress transmitted to the trial tray than in fixed bearing systems.** The result of this is a reduced loosening of the tray component.\n*   **Finally, use of the TC3-RP limits their surgeons to use of trial trays that do not have sleeve options.** The TC3-RP however, can be used with the M.I.T. Revision Tray which can be used with five sleeve sizes."}
