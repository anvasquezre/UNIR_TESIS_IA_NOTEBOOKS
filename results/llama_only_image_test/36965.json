{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"he values in the y-axis represent the PERCENT WEIGHT CHANGE in the rat population being studied. The y-axis is labeled \"PER CENT\" and ranges from 0 to 40, indicating a scale of percent weight change. This suggests that the graph is showing the percentage change in weight of the rats over time, with higher values indicating a greater weight change.\n\nThis is further supported by the presence of other y-axis labels, which appear to be related to weight measurements. Specifically, the y-axis is labeled with the following:\n\n* 5 GIVE 1 OM FAT PER KILO BODY WEIGHT\n* 5 GIVE 1 OM 5% DEUTEROSE IN WATER PER KILO BODY WEIGHT\n\nThese labels suggest that the weight change measurements are being expressed in units of grams (g) and grams per kilogram of body weight (g/kg)."}
