{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The Conference was started on October 20, though it appears that the start date may be incorrect as it is marked \"a.m.\" in the document, and it appears to start with a registration at 8am.\n\nThis could be the case if the conference began on a prior day, but I was unable to determine this, as the image is cut-off and only the date \"Thursday\" can be made out at the top of the document, prior to the heading, which reads:\n\nCONFERENCE ON OBESITY AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC: A Task Force Analysis and Recommendations for Public Action\n\nThere are not any dates listed in this document. Therefore the Conference likely started on Thursday, though the date cannot be accurately determined as the document does not contain the start date of the Conference.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is October 20."}
