{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the maximum value at the x-axis of both plots, we need to identify the highest point on the x-axis of each graph.\n\nIn the first plot, the x-axis represents the \"Tar\" yield from medium cartridges. The highest point on the x-axis is approximately at 726 puffs.\n\nIn the second plot, the x-axis represents the \"Nicotine\" yield from medium cartridges. The highest point on the x-axis is also approximately at 726 puffs.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value at the x-axis of both plots is 726 puffs."}
