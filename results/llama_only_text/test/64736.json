{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"``json\n{\"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"\", \"title\": \"Answer\"}}\n```\n\nHowever, since the actual problem is that the `answer` property is being passed as a string that is actually a JSON object, but the expected type is `string`, I think the best solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"{'title': 'Item', 'default': '', 'type':'string'}\"}\n```"}
