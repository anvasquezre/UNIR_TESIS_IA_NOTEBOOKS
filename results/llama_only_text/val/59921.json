{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"``json\n{\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"default\": \"\",\n    \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\",\n    \"title\": \"Answer\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe issue was that the JSON instance did not conform to the output schema. The schema defines \"answer\" as an object with properties, but in the JSON instance, it was defined as a dictionary with a single property \"type\". The schema expects all properties of the \"answer\" object to be specified."}
