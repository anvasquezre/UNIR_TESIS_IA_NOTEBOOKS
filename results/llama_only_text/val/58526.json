{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"``json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"The answer to the question.\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this fixed JSON, the value of \"answer\" is a string, conforming to the schema. If you want to include the \"title\" and \"description\" fields, you would need to modify the schema to allow additional properties. Here's an example of how you can do that:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"title\": \"Answer\",\n        \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, based on the error message, it seems that the \"answer\" field should be a string without any nested fields. The above example does not conform to the schema."}
