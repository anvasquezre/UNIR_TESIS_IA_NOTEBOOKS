{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"``json\n{\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"title\": \"Answer\",\n        \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\",\n        \"default\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON has been modified to fit the output schema:\n- The `additionalProperties` key has been added to indicate that the JSON object may have properties other than `answer`.\n- The `required` key has been removed as it's not present in the original object.\n- The `properties` key was present but the structure has been adapted to the provided schema. The structure is correct but it doesn't align perfectly with the schema.\n\nConsidering the error message, the problem arises from the missing quotes in the object \"answer\". The schema dictates that the answer should be a valid string. Here is the revised output schema that conforms to the original format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"title\": \"Answer\",\n    \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\",\n    \"default\": \"\" \n  }\n}\n```"}
