{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"``json\n{\"answer\": {\"default\": \"\", \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\", \"type\": \"string\"}}\n```\n\nThe error is due to the presence of the `title` field, but the schema does not allow it. However, the `title` field is a valid property in the JSON schema, it is the title of the field. In this case, `title` and `type` properties are inside `answer` field. Here's the corrected JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"title\": \"Answer\",\n    \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\",\n    \"default\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```"}
