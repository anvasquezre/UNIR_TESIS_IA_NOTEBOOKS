{"answer":"8. CHOLESTEROL is a waxy material used in many of the body's chemical processes. Too much cholesterol in the blood encourages the development of heart and blood vessel disease.\n\n Cholesterol in the blood comes from two sources: it is manufactured by the body; and it is absorbed directly from foods of animal origin.\n\n Meat, fish and poultry contain cholesterol. Egg yolks and organ meats are very high in cholesterol. Such foods are limited in low fat diets. There is no cholesterol in foods of plant origin, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, cereal and nuts, and generous use of these foods is recommended."}
