{"answer":"NNK or 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone is a tobacco- specific nitrosamine which is formed during the curing and smoking of tobacco. Formation during curing occurs through nitrosation. Occurrence in smoke results from pyrosynthesis or by direct transfer from tobacco. NNK is found in both mainstream smoke and in sidestream smoke. NNK is carcinogenic in laboratory animals."}
