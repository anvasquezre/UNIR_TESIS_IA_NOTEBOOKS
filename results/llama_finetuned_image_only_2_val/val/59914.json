{"answer":"These foods give you energy plus vim, vigor and vitality. Cookies, jam, jelly, syrup, peanuts and soft drinks also give you energy. They are pleasant to eat and drink, so enjoy them, but come to the table with a good appetite and eat heartily at every meal if you want to be strong and healthy. A snack or a soft drink in the middle of the morning or afternoon will help keep you feeling good and full of pep."}
