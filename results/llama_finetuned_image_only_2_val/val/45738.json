SEM: Standard error of the adjusted mean * p < 0.05, ** p <0.01 4.10 Quality of Life The influence CE/TMG on quality of life (QoL) was assessed by identifying changes on the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The WHQ measures the patient's own assessment of her changes in health and well-being during the menopause transition. The SF-36 is a generic measure of functioning and well being not related to any specific age or gender groups The analysis indicated that administration of continuous combined CE /TMG 0.0625 mg and sequential CE /TMG 0. 125 mg to postmenopausal women leads to significant improvements in QoL when compared with placebo. As measured by the WHQ, improvements were observed in the domains of vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, somatic symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, and attractiveness; no significant differences were seen for the domains of anxiety/fears and depressed mood. For the sequential regimens, as with any sequential regimens designed to provide regular monthly withdrawal bleeding, scores for the menstrual symptoms domain were less favorable (p < 0.05) compared with the placebo group.
