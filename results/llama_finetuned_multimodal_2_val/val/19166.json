{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"4\" is written in the document, however the fax message states  \"IF ANY PART OF THIS MESSAGE IS UNCLEAR, CALL:\". So, the number of pages written in the message is unclear. However, there are 4 pages (including cover page) mentioned in this document. So, the total number of pages mentioned in both the document and the fax message is \"4\". But the question asks about the \"Fax Message\", not the \"document\". In the Fax message, it is written \"NO. OF PAGES 4 (INCLUDING COVER PAGE)\" which means that it is unclear whether there are 4 pages or more. But, the document says that there are 4 pages (including cover page), so it is correct to say that there are 4 pages or more in the Fax message too. But since the question does not ask about the document, but the Fax message, the number of pages written in the Fax message is \"4\", not \"4 or more\". Therefore, the answer is \"4\". \n\nAnswer: 4"}
