{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Here is the JSON with the error fixed:\n```json)\n{\"answer\": \"Growers Questionnaire\"}\n```\n\nThis JSON is well-formatted and meets the JSON schema: {\"additionalProperties\": true, \"properties\": {\"answer\": {\"default\": \"\", \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\", \"title\": \"Answer\", \"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\nHowever, I noticed that \"wer\" was the error key. \"wer\" is not a standard JSON key and can be replaced with \"answer\" to standardize the JSON key. \n\nOr if there is some meaning behind \"wer\" then it should be replaced with the correct meaning. But for now, for the sake of the exercise, I have replaced it with \"answer\". \n\nNow, the JSON is formatted correctly according to the schema."}
