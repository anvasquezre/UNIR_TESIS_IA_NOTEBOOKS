{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"```json\n{\"answer\": \"r\": \"62273\"}}\n```\n\nshould be formatted as \n```json\n{\"answer\": \"r\": \"62272\"}}\n```\n\nOr simply \"answer\" can be removed to keep only the required \"R\" value. In this case, it might not be possible because  \"answer\" is in the original data.\nBut to format it according to the schema, you should use the schema that does not require \"answer\" property. The schema is given below\n\n```json\n{\"properties\": {\"R\": {\"default\": \"\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"title\": \"R\", \"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```"}
