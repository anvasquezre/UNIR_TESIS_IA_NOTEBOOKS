{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Here is the corrected JSON:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"11-23-56\", \"answer\": \"11-23-56\"}\n```\nor more correctly formatted:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"11-23-56\", \"output\": \"11-23-56\"}\n```\n\nHowever, the error in the original question suggests that \"11-23-56\" is both input and output, so a better representation could be:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"11-23-56\"}\n```\nThis assumes \"answer\" is the only missing key, and \"11-23-56\" is actually the \"input\" and \"output\" but not relevant. \n\nThe original \"error description\" is also in a non-standard JSON format, which we would normally format as follows:\n```json\n{\"error\": \"failed to parse llm response\"}\n``` \n\nSo the final, correctly formatted JSON should look like:\n```json\n{\"error\": \"failed to parse llm response\", \"answer\": \"11-23-56\", \"output\": \"11-23-56\"}\n```"}
