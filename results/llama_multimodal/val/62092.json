{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the average of all samples at 0:00, the values from each sample need to be added up and then divided by the total number of samples.\n\n**Step 1: Add up the values from each sample**\n- Sample 1: 131.0\n- Sample 2: 127.5\n- Sample 3: 130.0\n\nTotal sum = 131.0 + 127.5 + 130.0 = 388.5\n\n**Step 2: Divide the sum by the number of samples**\nTotal number of samples = 3\n\nAverage = Total sum / Total number of samples = 388.5 / 3 = 129.5\n\nThe average of all samples at 0:00 is **129.5**."}
