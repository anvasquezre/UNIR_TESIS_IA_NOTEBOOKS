{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Week 3.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe question asks about the week when the cumulative increase in weight for Group C is the highest before week 4.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that:\n\n*   Before week 4, there is no data available for week 5.\n*   Therefore, the cumulative increase in weight for week 5 cannot be compared with the rest of the data.\n*   The highest point for the cumulative increase in weight for Group C before week 4 can only be compared with the other weeks up to week 3.\n*   As the line graph indicates, week 3 has a higher cumulative increase in weight than the previous weeks for Group C.\n\nHence, the highest cumulative increase in weight for Group C before week 4 is found in **Week 3**."}
