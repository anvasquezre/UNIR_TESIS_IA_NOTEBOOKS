{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the average of all samples at 8:00, we must first identify the samples taken at that specific time and then calculate the average. According to the table provided:\n\n- The samples taken at 8:00 are 126.0, 125.0, and 129.0.\n- To find the average, we sum these values: 126.0 + 125.0 + 129.0 = 380.\n- Finally, we divide the sum by the number of samples, which is 3: 380 / 3 = 126.67.\n\n*Answer*: 126.67"}
