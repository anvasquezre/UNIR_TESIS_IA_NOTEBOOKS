{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Answer:**\n\nThe X-axis of the first plot is labeled **\"Time (hrs)\"**, which represents the independent variable in the experiment. This axis measures the duration of the measurement or observation over time, providing insights into the relationship between variables.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe X-axis in the first plot is crucial for understanding the trend and pattern of the data collected over time. The label \"Time (hrs)\" clearly indicates that the X-axis is representing the passage of hours, which is an important aspect of many experiments or observations. By analyzing this axis, researchers can infer how the dependent variable changes in relation to time, offering valuable information about the underlying mechanisms or phenomena being studied."}
