{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"o determine which estrogenic compound has the highest quantity in a 0.625 mg tablet of Premarin, we need to analyze the given table. The table shows the concentration of different estrogenic compounds identified and quantified in Premarin, along with their respective mg/0.625 mg Tablet* values.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the estrogenic compounds and their concentrations**\n\nThe table lists the following estrogenic compounds and their concentrations in a 0.625 mg tablet of Premarin:\n\n* Estrone: 0.370\n* Equilin: 0.168\n* 17α-Dihydroequilin: 0.102\n* 17α-Estradiol: 0.027\n* 17β-Dihydroequilin: 0.011\n* 17α-Dihydroequilenin: 0.011\n* 17β-Dihydroequilenin: 0.021\n* Equilenin: 0.015\n* 17β-Estradiol: 0.005\n* Δ8,9-Dehydroestrone: 0.026\n\n**Step 2: Compare the concentrations and determine the highest value**\n\nBy comparing the concentrations, we can see that estrone has the highest concentration at 0.370 mg/0.625 mg Tablet*.\n\nTherefore, the estrogenic compound with the highest quantity in a 0.625 mg tablet of Premarin is **estrone**, with a concentration of 0.370 mg/0.625 mg Tablet*."}
