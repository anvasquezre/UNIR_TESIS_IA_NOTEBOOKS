{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"SD stands for Standard Deviation. It is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation represents how much individual data points deviate from the average value of the dataset. In statistics, a high standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be spread out from the average, while a low standard deviation indicates that the values are tightly packed around the average."}
