{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the answer, we must calculate the average of Sample 1, which includes the following measurements:\n\n* 131.0 at 0:00\n* 128.5 at 4:00\n* 126.0 at 8:00\n* 127.5 at 24:00\n\nWe can find the average by adding these values together and dividing by 4.\n\nCalculation: (131.0 + 128.5 + 126.0 + 127.5) / 4 = 512.0 / 4 = 128.0\n\nTherefore, the average of Sample 1 is **128.0**."}
