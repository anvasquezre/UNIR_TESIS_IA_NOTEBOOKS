{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the year of inception of the Association, we can analyze the information provided on the cover page:\n\n*   The title of the document states it is the \"Golden Anniversary,\" which means it is being held fifty years after the Association's inception.\n*   The dates mentioned on the cover page are October 2-3, 1956. Since the anniversary is being held in 1956, the Association must have been founded fifty years before that.\n\nTherefore, the year of inception of the Association can be calculated as follows:\n\n*   1956 (year of the anniversary) - 50 (number of years) = 1906\n\nConsequently, the year of inception of the Association is indeed 1906."}
