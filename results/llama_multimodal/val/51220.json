{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Commodity chemicals and building block chemicals may have hundreds or thousands of discrete and readily identifiable uses. In some cases, \"major\" intermediate and end uses of chemicals will be readily apparent from reporting already made to EPA or other credible sources of public information. Information of varying quality, integrity, credibility, and reliability is available about \"uses\" of chemicals on the internet, social media, and online journals. A significant amount of information available over the internet is from anonymous sources or anecdotal in nature. EPA should apply its Quality System to information collected and evaluated to identify conditions of use in the pre-scoping stage, and ensure that it has conducted a data assessment to verify that they are of sufficient quantity and adequate quality for their intended use (to define the scope of the risk assessment)."}
