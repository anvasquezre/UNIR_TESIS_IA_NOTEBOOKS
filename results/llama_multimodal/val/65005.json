{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the answer, we need to look at the equation on the line graph for systolic pressure. The equation is Y = 114 + 1.60X, where X represents the salt intake in grams per day. \n\nThe value of Y represents the systolic pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). In other words, Y is the value of the systolic pressure that corresponds to a given level of salt intake. Therefore, the value of Y is not a fixed number, but rather a function of the salt intake.\n\nThe final answer is: **Variable**"}
