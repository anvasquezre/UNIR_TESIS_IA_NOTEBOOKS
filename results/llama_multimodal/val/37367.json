{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the rightmost word in the first line, we need to look at the first line of the text and identify the word that appears at the end of the sentence.\n\nThe first line of the text is: \"ROBERT E. SHANK, M.D.,\"\n\nThe word that appears at the end of this line is \"M.D,\". However, this is an abbreviation and does not meet the requirement of being the \"rightmost word.\"\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the first line is a title or heading, and it ends with the phrase \"M.D.\" which stands for \"Doctor of Medicine.\" This abbreviation is commonly used in medical contexts to indicate that someone holds a doctoral degree in medicine.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided text, the rightmost word in the first line is actually \"M.D.\" but if we consider it in the context of a common noun, the answer could be \"rightmost\", which does not refer to the location on the line but rather to the object that is being discussed, which in this case is the answer to the question."}
