{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"This is an inter-office correspondence (I.O.C.) document. It's a letter, not a formal request, and it seems to be discussing research and referencing other documents. The heading at the top includes the name of the document type, and it's dated, so it's clear that it's a correspondence between colleagues or organizations. The content suggests a conversation between two people about a topic, rather than a request or demand."}
