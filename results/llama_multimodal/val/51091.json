{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of PHAs that are provided guidance, we need to analyze the given text.\n\nThe relevant sentence from the text is: \"Provide guidance to the more than 2600 PHAs that will adopt the new rule via evaluation of Executive Directors, staff, and residents at 150 randomly selected sites and critique of written policies.\"\n\nFrom this sentence, it is clear that the guidance is being provided to more than 2600 PHAs, but the exact number is not specified. However, we can infer that the guidance is being provided to all these PHAs through a process that involves:\n\n1. Evaluation of Executive Directors, staff, and residents at 150 randomly selected sites.\n2. Critique of written policies.\n\nThis implies that the guidance is being provided to all PHAs, regardless of the location or size. Therefore, the number of PHAs provided guidance is more than 2600.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: 2600**"}
