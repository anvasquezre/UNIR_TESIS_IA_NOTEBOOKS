{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine which step \"figure 4\" refers to, we need to analyze the given text. The text states that \"figure 3\" refers to step 3, and \"figure 4\" is described in a separate paragraph after step 3. This indicates that figure 4 does not refer to step 3 but rather to step 4.\n\n**Step 4** is described as:\n\n\"To remove the Ultamet insert from the shell, impact the extraction handle lightly one to two times. The resulting vibration will release the taper lock between the Ultamet insert and the Pinnacle shell. The insert will be lifted out of the shell by the suction cup mechanism.\"\n\nTherefore, figure 4 corresponds to **step 4**."}
