{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To answer this question, we need to find the year or period when the number of \"replied\" is close to the number of \"refused\".\n\nStep 1: Look at the table provided and find the columns for \"replied\" and \"refused\".\nStep 2: Compare the values in the \"replied\" column with the values in the \"refused\" column across different years or periods.\nStep 3: Identify the year or period where the values in the \"replied\" and \"refused\" columns are close to each other.\n\nAfter analyzing the table, I found that the number of \"replied\" and \"refused\" were relatively equal in 1974. In that year, 1,554 twins were replied, and 516 were refused.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **1970-1974**"}
