{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Non-smoking room. Martin prefers a non-smoking room. This is indicated by the checkmark next to \"No\" for \"I am not interested in playing golf on Sunday, October 13\" and the lack of a checkmark next to \"Yes - I would like to play golf with the group on Sunday, October 13\". Additionally, the handwritten note \"I would like Teresa to make my airline reservations\" suggests that Martin is also preferring non-smoking."}
