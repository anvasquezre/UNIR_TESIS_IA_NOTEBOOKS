{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"he plot is labelled \"LOSS OF THIAMINE (%)\". The y-axis shows the percentage of thiamine loss, with values ranging from 0 to 50%. The graph indicates that the loss of thiamine varies depending on the method used for heating, with the highest loss observed in the autoclaving in sealed tube (120Â°C) treatment.\n\nThe y-axis is therefore a representation of the loss of thiamine measured as a percentage."}
