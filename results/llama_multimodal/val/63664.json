{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the total degrees of freedom, we need to add up the degrees of freedom from each source:\n\n* Children (C): 4\n* Periods (P): 7\n* C x P: 28\n* C x D: 8\n* P x D: 14\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. Children (C) + Periods (P) = 4 + 7 = 11\n2. C x P + C x D = 11 + 28 = 39\n3. P x D + Total = 39 + 14 = 53\n\n**Total Degrees of Freedom:** 53\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not 112, but 53."}
