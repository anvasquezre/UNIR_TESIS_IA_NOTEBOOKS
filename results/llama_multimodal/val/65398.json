{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The image appears to be a document or webpage with a list of references, but it does not show the page number. However, based on the information provided in the image, it is possible to infer that there are 11 references mentioned. The text \"References\" at the top of the page suggests that the list is a list of references. Additionally, the presence of 11 bullet points with numbers (1-11) at the beginning of each reference implies that there are 11 references in total.\n\nTo provide a more definitive answer, it would be helpful if the page number could be confirmed. If the page number is 1, it is likely that there are more than 11 references. However, based on the information provided in the image, it can be concluded with reasonable certainty that there are 11 references mentioned."}
