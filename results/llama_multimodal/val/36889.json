{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"he voucher lists direct salaries under the category of direct materials and other direct costs, so the answer would be zero, which is not the most suitable answer. Another category named \"Direct Salaries\" with an amount of $778.32, but \"Other Direct Costs\" has the value of $18.00, and the question specifically asks about Direct Salaries. Assuming \"Direct Salaries\" and \"Direct Materials\" are not listed in the other direct costs section, and other costs include material, salary, and salary-related expenses like overtime and training expenses, this question can only be answered with an approximate value. So the best answer would be approximately $800."}
