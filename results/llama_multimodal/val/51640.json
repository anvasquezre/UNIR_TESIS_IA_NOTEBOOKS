{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the required entry on the last two lines, we need to analyze the document's layout and content.\n\n* The first line contains the text \"Form 370-100M-10-67 Pads 100\", indicating that this is likely a form or document related to a specific company or industry.\n* The second line appears to be a section header or title, with the text \"DATE\" in all capital letters, suggesting that this line is used to record the date of a particular event or transaction.\n* The third line contains the text \"TO\", which may indicate the recipient or beneficiary of the document or action.\n* The fourth line is marked \"FROM\", implying that this line is used to record the sender or initiator of the document or action.\n* The fifth line is labeled \"REMARKS\", indicating that this line is intended for any additional comments, explanations, or clarifications.\n\nGiven these observations, it seems logical that the last two lines of the document would be used to specify the recipient and sender of a document or action. Therefore, the entries required along these lines would be:\n\n* Recipient (or To): _______________________________________________\n* Sender (or From): ______________________________________________"}
