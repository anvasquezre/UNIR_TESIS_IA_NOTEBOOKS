{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the percentage of raw material imported in the previous year, we first need to identify the total value of raw materials imported in the previous year and the value of raw materials imported in the current year.\n\nAccording to the provided document, the following values are:\n\n- Total value of raw materials imported in the previous year: 330.44 lakhs\n- Value of raw materials imported in the current year: 1596.85 lakhs\n\nWe can calculate the percentage of raw material imported in the previous year using the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Value of raw material imported in previous year / Value of raw material imported in current year) x 100\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPercentage = (330.44 / 1596.85) x 100 â‰ˆ 20.77%\n\nThis means that the percentage of raw material imported in the previous year is approximately 20.77%.\n\nAnswer: The answer is **20.77%**."}
