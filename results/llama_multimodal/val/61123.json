{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"According to the information provided, five suggestions were offered for the problem. These suggestions are as follows:\n\n1. Lack of protein availability should be attacked by supplementation or fortification, depending on what is available under the circumstances.\n2. Incentives should be producer-oriented, and U.S. industry participation should be part of the total concept. Perhaps this participation could be in the form of a consortium. However, it should be kept in mind that local governments require incentives also.\n3. Lack of food standards should be approached both from the need for fortification and enrichment regulations and from the problem of handling and utilization of wastes.\n4. U.S. type protein rich foods should not be discouraged.\n5. Within a particular country the pilot project approach should receive priority since it can serve as a showcase of tangible results."}
