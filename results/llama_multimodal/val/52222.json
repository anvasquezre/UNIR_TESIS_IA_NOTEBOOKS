However, the document does indicate that he worked there from 1910, and the only other known fact is that he was born in 1887. This implies that he likely started working there in his early or late twenties.\n\nHowever, as a disclaimer, there is an indication that CLAUDE T.CARNEY's job as a Bench chemist at Fort Morgan started in 1909. Given this information, it seems most likely that he likely started working at Windsor beet lab sometime around 1910.\n\nConclusion: CLAUDE T.CARNEY likely started working at Windsor beet lab sometime around 1910."}
