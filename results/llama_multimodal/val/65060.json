{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The answer to what is handwritten within brackets can be determined by closely examining the image. Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the text \"DAYS\" is indeed handwritten within brackets.\n\nThe image shows a scanned document with a clear typewritten header that reads \"Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program.\" Below this heading, the text \"(DAYS)\" is handwritten in brackets. This indicates that the text \"DAYS\" is not part of the original typewritten content but rather an annotation added by someone who scanned or copied the document. The handwriting in the brackets suggests that it was added after the original document was created."}
