{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The note appears to say 'Dorothy. Please note & advise me', however this may not be a reliable statement. The writing on the note appears to be somewhat indecipherable, suggesting that it could be difficult or even impossible to understand the intended meaning. The image itself is a scanned document, which can further reduce the readability of the handwritten note. Therefore, the note may not be in a legible format and a professional opinion could not be rendered based on the text alone."}
