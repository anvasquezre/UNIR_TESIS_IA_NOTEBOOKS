{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine which subject had the highest pulse rate in the baseline period, we need to examine the pulse rate data for each subject during this time. The data is presented in a graph with the x-axis representing the baseline period and the y-axis representing the pulse rate in beats per minute (bpm). \n\nLooking at the graph, we can see that each subject's pulse rate is plotted as a dot on the graph, and the mean pulse rate for each subject is represented by a solid line. We are interested in the highest point on each line during the baseline period. \n\nSince there is no clear indication of the subjects' numbers in the image, it is difficult to determine which subject has the highest pulse rate. Therefore, we cannot definitively identify which subject had the highest pulse rate in the baseline period based solely on the information provided."}
