{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"According to the table, the degrees of freedom for the interaction between the source of variance (C) and periods (P), which is represented by (C x P), is 28.\n\nThis value is derived from the calculation of 28 * 2, resulting in a total degrees of freedom for (C x P) as 56, as illustrated in the provided table.\n\nConclusion:\nThe degrees of freedom for (C x P) is 28.\n\nAnswer: 28"}
