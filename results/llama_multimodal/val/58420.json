{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The graph shows a scale with tick marks representing different values. The triangle on the graph is located at the point where the x-axis value is around 10 and the y-axis value is around 20. \n\nThis means that the triangle represents a value of about 20 mmol/mol of thiamine in the x-axis units, which corresponds to approximately 10 minutes of time in the y-axis units.\n\nTherefore, the triangle represents a value of approximately 20 mmol/mol of thiamine in the x-axis units at around 10 minutes of time in the y-axis units."}
