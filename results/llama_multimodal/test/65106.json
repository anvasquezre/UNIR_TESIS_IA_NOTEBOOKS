{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The graph provided indicates that the admissions in 1976 correspond to an asterisked entry. However, this entry lacks a numerical value, as stated in the graph's footnote: \"*1976 figure is analyzation based on 5 months.\" Therefore, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer based on the information presented.\n\nIn the absence of specific numerical data for 1976, one cannot accurately determine the admissions figure for that year. The available data only accounts for admissions through October 1975 and then again for January through May 1976, which does not allow for a complete calculation."}
