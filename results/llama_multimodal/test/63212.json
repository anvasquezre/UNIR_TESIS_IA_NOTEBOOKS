{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the number of stepped care for those whose status is unknown in Atlanta, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant column: The column labeled \"Living Status Unknown Referred%\" is where we find the percentage of referred cases with unknown living status. However, we are interested in the count rather than the percentage, so we need to look for the corresponding \"Stepped N\" column.\n\n2. Look for the relevant data: Since the document provides data for each city, we need to find the row for Atlanta (ATL).\n\n3. Find the count of stepped care: In the ATL row, we can see that the count of stepped care is 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of stepped care for those whose status is unknown in ATL is **6**."}
