{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the nightly rate for one room at the hotel listed, we will first multiply the nightly rate of 3 nights of two rooms by two to account for two nights only:\n\n$14,850/3 nights x 2 = $9,900\n\nThen divide that amount by two to calculate the per-night rate for one room:\n\n$9,900 / 2 rooms = $4,950\n\nFinally, divide $9,900 by two to calculate the rate for one room/night:\n\n$9,900 / 2 = $4,950\n\nSo, the rate for 1 room/night is $4,950."}
