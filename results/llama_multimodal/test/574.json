{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"According to the question's instructions, I will provide an answer using the information that I was given about the image.\n\nAs an image-based large language model, I do not have the capability to extract or access text-based information. I can only respond based on what is visually present in the image. In this case, the image is too blurry to read and does not provide any information about the product line. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the question about whether the Camel Special Lights will be introduced nationally at rollout.\n\nAs an answer, I will use the prompt's instruction: \"Please provide a clear, 3-5 sentence response to the question, either Yes or No with explanation, if available.\" However, since I don't have the information available to answer the question correctly, I will use the format but replace it with a neutral response: \n\n\"No information is available to answer the question about whether the Camel Special Lights will be introduced nationally at rollout.\"\n\n**Answer:** No information is available to answer the question about whether the Camel Special Lights will be introduced nationally at rollout."}
