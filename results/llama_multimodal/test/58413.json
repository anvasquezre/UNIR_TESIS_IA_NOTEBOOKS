{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the percentage of subjects with a vegan diet, we need to look at the \"types of diets\" table provided in the image. The table shows the number of men and women who followed each type of diet.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of men who followed a vegan diet. According to the table, there were 20 men who followed a vegan diet.\n\nStep 2: Identify the total number of subjects (men and women combined) who followed any type of diet. To find this, we add up the number of men who followed each type of diet and the number of women who followed each type of diet.\n\nMen:\n* Vegan: 20\n* Lacto-vegetarian: 24\n* Ovo-vegetarian: 24\n* Ovo-lacto-vegetarian: 4\n* Omnivore: 14\n\nWomen:\n* Vegan: 20\n* Lacto-vegetarian: 28\n* Ovo-vegetarian: 28\n* Ovo-lacto-vegetarian: 4\n* Omnivore: 14\n\nTotal number of subjects who followed any type of diet = (20 + 24 + 24 + 4 + 14) + (20 + 28 + 28 + 4 + 14) = 122 (men) + 122 (women) = 244\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of subjects who followed a vegan diet.\n\nPercentage of men who followed a vegan diet = (Number of men who followed a vegan diet / Total number of men) * 100\n= (20 / 122) * 100\n= 16.39%\n\nPercentage of women who followed a vegan diet = (Number of women who followed a vegan diet / Total number of women) * 100\n= (20 / 122) * 100\n= 16.39%\n\nOverall percentage of subjects who followed a vegan diet = (Total number of men who followed a vegan diet + Total number of women who followed a vegan diet) / Total number of subjects) * 100\n= ((20 + 20) / 244) * 100\n= 16.39%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of subjects who have vegan diet is 16.39%."}
