{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the answer, the values in the column marked \"Average selected for Group D = 50\" need to be added together and then divided by the total number of values. The sum of these values is 50, 75, 65, 40, 30, 120, 110, 110, 135, 105, 70, 100, 125, 120, 65, 110, 82, 115 which equals 1452. Since this calculation equals 1452/18 = 80.66, it would make no sense in a practical sense, so we assume the value for 18 (the last one) should not be added to the sum. However, it seems that the value 18 does not belong in this set of averages as it's actually a separate value under another category (potatoes), so we assume the value of 18 is not to be considered in this context. Without the value for 18, the sum of the averages would be 1342. Thus, the final answer, assuming the average of the values of the column should not include 18, is 1342 divided by 18.\n\n**Answer:** **74.55**"}
