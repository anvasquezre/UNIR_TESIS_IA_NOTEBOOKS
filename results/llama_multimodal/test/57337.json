{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for net worth per share, follow these steps:\n\n* **Step 1: Identify the initial and final values.**\n\t+ The initial value is not provided; however, it is given as 112 in the image.\n\t+ The final value is 187.92.\n* **Step 2: Determine the number of periods.**\n\t+ There are five periods: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2011.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the growth rate using the formula.**\n\nCAGR = ((FV / IV) ^ (1/n)) - 1\n\nwhere:\n- CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate\n- FV = Final Value (187.92)\n- IV = Initial Value (112)\n- n = Number of periods (5)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nCAGR = ((187.92 / 112) ^ (1/5)) - 1\n= (1.6768 ^ 0.2) - 1\n= 1.1486 - 1\n= 0.1486 or 14.86%\n\nRounding the answer to two decimal places, we get 14.86%.\n\n**The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for net worth per share is 14.86%.**"}
