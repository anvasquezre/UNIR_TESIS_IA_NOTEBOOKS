{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Alcohol consumption is higher at home.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, refer to the second row of the table, titled \"Alcohol\". In that row, two columns are provided: \"HOME\" and \"AWAY\". The numerical value displayed under the \"HOME\" column indicates the amount of alcohol consumed at home, and the value under the \"AWAY\" column represents the amount of alcohol consumed away from home.\n\nSince the numerical value displayed under the \"HOME\" column is 6.2, which is greater than the value of 7.6 in the \"AWAY\" column, alcohol consumption is indeed higher at home."}
