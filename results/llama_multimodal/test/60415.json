{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the average body weight of the treated pigs at 3 days of age, we need to look at the \"Body Wt. at 3 days age\" column in the table. \n\nThe numbers in this column represent the body weights of the individual pigs at 3 days of age. However, we are asked for the average body weight, so we need to calculate the mean of these values.\n\nThe formula for calculating the mean is:\n\nMean = (Sum of values) / (Number of values)\n\nIn this case, we have the following values:\n\n2.9, 2.6, 3.7, 3.0, 3.2, 2.9\n\nTo calculate the sum, we add up these values:\n\n2.9 + 2.6 + 3.7 + 3.0 + 3.2 + 2.9 = 18.3\n\nNext, we divide the sum by the number of values:\n\n18.3 / 6 = 3.05\n\nTherefore, the average body weight of the treated pigs at 3 days of age is 3.05 lbs."}
