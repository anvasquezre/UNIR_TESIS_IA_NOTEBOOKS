{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Calculating the Premium**\n\nTo calculate the premium, we need to analyze the provided information in the table. The table has three columns:\n\n* If You Have Salary Deductions For Blue Cross and Blue Shield\n* If You Have Salary Deductions For Blue Shield Only\n* If You Do Not Have Salary Deductions For Blue Cross nor Blue Shield\n\nEach column has two rows:\n\n* For Employee Only\n* For Dependent Coverage\n\nWe are interested in the column \"If You Do Not Have Salary Deductions For Blue Cross nor Blue Shield\" because it represents the situation where there are no deductions.\n\nIn this column, for the row \"For Employee Only\", the premium is $2.96.\n\nTherefore, the premium of employee coverage having no deductions is $2.96.\n\n*Answer*: $2.96"}
