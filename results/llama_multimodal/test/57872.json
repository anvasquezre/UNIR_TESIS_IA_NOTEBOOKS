{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question asks which ITC Director also holds directorship in MMMTC Limited. To answer this, we need to identify the directors mentioned in the provided text and check if any of them have a directorship in MMMTC Limited.\n\nThe text lists several ITC Directors:\n\n* K.N. Grant\n* Kurush N. Grant (54)\n* Surya Nepal Private Limited*\n* King Maker Marketing, Inc., USA*\n* The Tollygunge Club Limited\n* Anil Baijal\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these directors have a directorship in MMMTC Limited. The text mentions that Anil Baijal joined the ITC Board as a Non-Executive Independent Director on January 22, 2010, and prior to this, was a Non-Executive Independent Director. However, it does not provide information about his current directorships.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided image, it appears that Anil Baijal is mentioned twice:\n\n1. As a representative of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India on the ITC Board from July 2007 to August 2009.\n2. As a Senior Advisor to the Infrastructure Development & Finance Company Limited, in addition to being the Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Airlines.\n\nWhile the first point mentions Anil Baijal as a representative of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India, it does not indicate that he held directorship in MMMTC Limited. The second point mentions that he is currently a Senior Advisor to the Infrastructure Development & Finance Company Limited, which is separate from his role as a representative. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Anil Baijal holds directorship in MMMTC Limited based on the provided information.\n\nThe final answer is: *Answer*: Anil Baijal"}
