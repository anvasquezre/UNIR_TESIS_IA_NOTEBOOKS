{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Calculating the Total Number of Men Respondents**\n\nTo determine the number of men who responded, we need to examine the provided data.\n\nThe document states that there are two hundred and nineteen (219) men respondents who responded out of a total of five hundred and six (506) respondents. To find the exact number of men, we can use the following information:\n\n* Total respondents: 506\n* Percentage of men: 219/506\n\nBy dividing 219 by 506, we can find that **43%** of the respondents are men.\n\nTherefore, out of a total of two hundred and nineteen (219) men respondents, the number of men who responded is **219**."}
