{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To calculate the percentage of vests available for conversion after 3 years, we need to use the following information:\n\n*   The exercise period is 5 years from the date of vesting.\n*   The number of months vested after 3 years is 36.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction of the exercise period that has been fulfilled:\n\n36 months / (5 years \\* 12 months/year) = 36/60 = 0.6\n\nThen, we use the information from the chart:\n\n*   On completion of 24 months from the date of grant of the Options, 30% vests.\n*   On completion of 36 months from the date of grant of the Options, 40% vests.\n\nSince 0.6 is closer to 0.4, we expect that at 3 years (36 months), approximately 40% of vests will be available for conversion.\n\n**Answer:** 40%"}
