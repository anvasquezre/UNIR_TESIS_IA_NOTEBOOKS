{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The number of knitted implantations is calculated by multiplying the number of cases where the patient's condition matches the criteria with the average number of implants per case. \n\nAccording to the text, there were 28 cases with knitted implantation.\n\nTo determine the total number of knitted implantations, we multiply the number of cases by the average number of implants per case:\n\n28 cases * average number of implants per case\n\nHowever, the exact average number of implants per case is not provided. Nevertheless, we can assume that the average number of implants per case is a reasonable number that would make sense in the context of medical implantations.\n\nGiven that this is a medical procedure and considering the context, it's plausible to estimate a reasonable number of implants per case. However, without additional information, the precise average cannot be determined. Thus, a definitive answer cannot be provided at this time.\n\nPlease provide further details or clarification regarding the average number of implants per case if possible, so an accurate calculation can be made."}
