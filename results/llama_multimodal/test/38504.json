{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Graph Analysis: Highest Value for \"Intake, mg/1000 kcal\"**\n\nThe graph displays the relationship between \"Intake, mg/1000 kcal\" on the x-axis and cholesterol levels on the y-axis. To determine the highest value plotted on the x-axis, we need to examine the scale of the graph.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the X-Axis Scale**\nThe x-axis is labeled as \"Intake, mg/1000 kcal.\" We need to identify the highest value plotted on this axis.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Highest Point**\nUpon examining the graph, we observe that the highest point on the x-axis corresponds to approximately 300 mg/1000 kcal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, the highest value plotted on the 'X' axis of the graph for \"Intake, mg/1000 kcal\" is **300**."}
