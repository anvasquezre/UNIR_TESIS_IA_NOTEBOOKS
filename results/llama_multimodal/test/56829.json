{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine the total number of people who participated in this study, we need to examine the provided image. The image appears to be a table summarizing various aspects of a research project. However, it does not directly provide the total number of participants. Instead, it contains columns and rows that seem to relate to the distribution of alcoholic drinks consumed by different categories over time.\n\nSince the total number of participants is not explicitly stated in the table, we can only speculate that the number may have been derived from the total count of responses or the cumulative sum of individual counts across each category. Without explicit mention or calculation within the provided context, the actual figure remains unknown based on this image alone.\n\nHowever, if one were to estimate the total from the given data, it would be challenging without additional information about how the categories are related to each other or how they add up to represent the entire dataset. Therefore, without further context or specific calculations, we cannot accurately determine the total number of people who participated in the study from the provided image."}
