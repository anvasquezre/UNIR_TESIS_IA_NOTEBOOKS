Salary will be commensurate with qualifications.\n\nThere is no clear indication that employment for this position will be limited to a specific duration of less than a year. However, it is worth noting that the job posting does mention that the position is a \"12-month full-time appointment\" and that the salary will be \"commensurate with qualifications.\" This suggests that the employer may be seeking an individual who is willing to commit to a longer-term employment arrangement."}
