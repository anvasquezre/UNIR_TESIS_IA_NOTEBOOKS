{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To find the year with the least number of candidates appearing for the Part III exam, we need to analyze the graph and identify the year with the smallest bar.\n\nUpon examining the graph, we can see that the year 1927 has the shortest bar, indicating that it has the least number of candidates appearing for the exam. This is evident from the fact that the bar for 1927 is significantly shorter than the bars for other years, indicating a lower number of candidates.\n\nTherefore, based on the graph, we can conclude that 1927 has the least number of candidates appearing for the Part III exam.\n\nThe final answer is 1927."}
