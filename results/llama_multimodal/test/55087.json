{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The table indicates the combined purchase interest of menthol in two different age demographics: 18–24 and 25–34.\n\n* 73% in the 18–24 age group\n* 72% in the 25–34 age group\n\nTotal purchase interest: 73 + 72 = 145%. However, this is not possible since the interest should be less than or equal to 100%. The mistake is likely due to rounding.\n\nCorrected answer:\n\n* 73% (for the 18–24 age group)\n* 72% (for the 25–34 age group)\n\nTotal purchase interest: 145%, but considering rounding, the correct total is 145%."}
