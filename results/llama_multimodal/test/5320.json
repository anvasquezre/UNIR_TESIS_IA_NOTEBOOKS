{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"n the history of economic development, there are times when converging needs and resources can radically change life-style, including in the history of energy improvements. For instance, individual mobility came about from the convergence of:\n\nA new energy source (oil with its high energy density):\n\n    *   Improved and new materials (quality steel, polymers)\n    *   New manufacturing techniques (assembly line production)\n    *   Social needs, such as wider choices for dwelling, working and leisure\n\nThe weight per passenger remains an area of potential improvement.\n\nThis process of continuous improvement is reflected at macro economic level. In the USA, energy intensity - the ratio of energy consumption to gross domestic product - has declined at an average of 1% p.a. over the last 100 years, with up to 2% p.a. being achieved for a decade under extreme price pressure.\n\nIn the history of economic development, there are times when converging needs and resources can radically change life-style, including in the history of energy improvements.

For example, the energy used in the industrial production of ammonia has seen a steady decline over an extended period of time through the adoption of new raw materials, processes and equipment. Today, only one-fifth of the energy required in 1910 is needed.\n\n**Converging Developments - 1920**\n\nOil\n\nCustomers' aspirations\n\nPolymers and Aluminum\n\nAssembly Line\n\nSteel\n\nMachine Tools\n\nIndividual Mobility (Automobile)\n\nAssembly Line\n\nMachine Tools\n\n**Growth in Car Population and Mobility**\n\nUSA\n\nFrance\n\n**As demand grew, energy supplies became more diversified**\n\nAs new needs appeared and economic development progressed, energy demand grew and consumption per capita in the world kept increasing over the last century, even"}
