{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"**Understanding the Data**\n\nThe provided table displays the results of a survey question, with columns for the total number of respondents (189-100%), men (116-100%), and women (73-100%). The question asked is: \"If no - Why don't you use sugar?\"\n\n**Calculating the Percentage of Women Who Did Not Respond**\n\nTo calculate the percentage of women who did not respond to this query, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = ((100 - Response Rate) / 100) * 100\n\nFrom the table, we see that the response rate for women is 73%. Plugging this value into the formula gives us:\n\nPercentage = ((100 - 73) / 100) * 100\n= (27 / 100) * 100\n= 27%\n\nTherefore, **27%** of women did not respond to this query."}
