{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"o find the price of one unit of nutriphonics, we need to look at the provided budget breakdown for the Nutrition Education - Olympics Project. The breakdown includes several costs, such as writing, design/photography, talent identification, sound production, technical sound master duplication, talent fees, administration/coordination/management, printing, packaging, equipment, indirect costs, and a corporate sponsor. However, the cost of one unit of nutriphonics is not directly mentioned in the budget breakdown.\n\nThe budget allocates $14.00 for equipment and states that there are 3,000 nutriphonics units. Therefore, to determine the price of one unit of nutriphonics, we can divide the total cost of equipment ($14.00) by the number of units (3,000).\n\nPrice per unit = Total Cost of Equipment / Number of Units\nPrice per unit = $14.00 / 3,000\nPrice per unit = $0.0046\n\nThe price of one unit of nutriphonics is $0.0046."}
