{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The figure notes that the anteversion is \"15°- 20°\", but does not mention what type of anteversion this is, so an assumption will need to be made.\nIn general, \"anteversion\" typically refers to the degree to which something is facing away from the front, in contrast with \"anteversion\" referring to a degree towards the front.\n\nTherefore, one could make the assumption that 15°- 20° would be typical for \"posterior\" anteversion.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 15°- 20°, typical of posterior anteversion. I hope it is correct."}
