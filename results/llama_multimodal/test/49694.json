{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The symbol * in the image indicates \"in thousands,\" which is commonly used to abbreviate units of currency, specifically thousand, or in other contexts such as measurement. The symbol * is used to replace the word \"in\" or the number \"in.\" It is a shortcut notation that saves space and makes the text more concise.\n\nFor example, in the image, the line item \"Atom Absorption Spectrometer\" has the symbol * followed by the number 17.0. This means that the cost of the item is 17,000 dollars (or thousands of dollars)."}
