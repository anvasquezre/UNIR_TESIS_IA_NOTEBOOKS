{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine which plot shows a higher peak, we need to compare the maximum values of the two curves. The x-axis represents serum cholesterol levels in mg/100ml, and the y-axis represents the number of children.\n\nThe U.S. curve peaks at approximately 30 children at a serum cholesterol level of around 250 mg/100ml, while the Mexican curve peaks at approximately 20 children at a serum cholesterol level of around 200 mg/100ml. Since 30 is greater than 20, the U.S. curve shows a higher peak.\n\nTherefore, the plot for the U.S. shows a higher peak.\n\nAnswer: The U.S."}
