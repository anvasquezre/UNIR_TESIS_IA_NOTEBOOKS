{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"To determine whether the number of patients discharged for oral surgery is higher in a private or ward setting, we need to compare the discharge numbers for both groups.\n\nAccording to the table, there are 186 patients discharged from the oral surgery department. However, the number of patients discharged from both private and ward settings is the same, which is 5 and 0 respectively. Therefore, the number of patients discharged for oral surgery is not higher in one setting over the other, as there is no difference between the two groups.\n\nThe final answer is: *Both settings have the same number of patients discharged*."}
