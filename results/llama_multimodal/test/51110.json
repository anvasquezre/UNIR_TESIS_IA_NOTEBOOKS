{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"The question can be answered by analyzing the text in the image. The image presents a slide discussing the NAS (2014) & IRIS Process, with the title \"NAS (2014) & IRIS Process\" at the top. The first bullet point, \"Finding: EPA could improve documentation and presentation of dose-response information,\" is followed by the second bullet point, \"Recommendation: EPA should clearly present two dose-response estimates: a central estimate (such as a maximum likelihood estimate or a posterior mean) and a lower-bound estimate for a POD from which a toxicity value is derived.\" This indicates that EPA should present at least two dose-response estimates."}
