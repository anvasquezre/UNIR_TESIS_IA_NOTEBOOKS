{"answer":"B. Inactive chemicals and new chemicals EPA makes clear in the preamble that \"all chemical substances listed on the TSCA Inventory are subject to prioritization\" and that it has authority to prioritize both new chemicals and inactive chemicals for risk evaluations under Section 6. The Agency also notes, however, that EPA does not expect new chemicals to be high priority candidates because EPA will be making risk determinations about new chemicals under Section 5. The Agency also notes that the Inventory Reset rulemaking will distinguish active from inactive chemicals in commerce, which will \"inform EPA's exposure judgments during the prioritization process.\" ACC interprets EPA's discussion to suggest that prioritization of inactive chemicals is anticipated to occur only in exceptional cases. Inactive chemicals, under the Inventory Reset definition, will not have been in commerce for the past 10 years, so prioritization of these will likely be reserved for \"legacy\" chemical issues, e.g., those whose disposal conditions may at some later point in time suggest the need for an updated TSCA risk evaluation to derive a risk management clean-up standard. It is ACC's view, however, that the broader directive to EPA in the LCSA is to focus its prioritization process on the designation of high and low priority chemicals that are active in commerce; and that the scope of the risk evaluation should focus on chemicals under those conditions of use that present the greatest or lowest potential for both toxicity and exposure."}
