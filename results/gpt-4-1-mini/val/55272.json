H. Preston, N. Keyfitz, and R. Schoen (1972). Causes of Death: Life Tables for National Populations, Seminar Press, New York, New York, and London. *Deaths per year per midyear population. * *Standardized to \"Western\" female stable population. This corrects all data to the same age distribution so that differences in crude rate owed to differences in fractions of the population at a given age are eliminated. The crude lifetime risks from all causes of death add to one. There is no correction in this value for competing risks of death."}
