{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"WOMEN \n\nNote: The number 0.0 in the last row of the table indicates that there is no such population at risk for women, and similarly there are no values under the column for 'population at risk' below the table. Hence, it's not possible to compare them directly but women's table seems to be more extensive and detailed. However, for 'ALL LEVELS' cholesterol, there is a clear disparity in 'rate/1000' where men have higher rates except for '55-64' age group. Under 'rate/1000' column for all levels, the last number written as \"20.1\" under 'Women' is actually 'Rate/10000' indicating that women have a significantly lower incidence of heart disease at all levels. It is important to note that table 1 is titled as 'Incidence of coronary heart disease by HDL cholesterol level Framingham study, Exam 11', suggesting the study compares two groups (men and women) based on an independent variable (HDL cholesterol level) which may result in some men with very low HDL and women with very high HDL. Hence it is essential to understand that 'population at risk' might not be a uniform characteristic across the two groups as the groups are divided based on various 'all levels'. The above observations also suggest that women generally have a lower incidence of heart disease at all levels, though there is some overlap in certain 'all levels' suggesting that other factors apart from HDL are also relevant. Given the context'men have lower \"rate/1000\" in \"65-74\" age group, but in all levels men generally have higher incidence except in very high \"rate/10000\" which suggests very low HDL or very high HDL cases), it seems logical to assume that the \"men\" column is titled 'Men', as it is a common mistake to compare 'incidence' in a way that may seem to show men have a lower incidence at some 'rate/1000' but that is misleading because the table actually suggests men have a higher incidence at some levels. But, given the study, it is essential to look into every single 'all level' which is what the table suggests. \n Source: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qzif0227"}
