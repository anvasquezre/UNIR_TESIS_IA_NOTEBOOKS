{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"```json\n{\"answer\": \"IDENTIFY POOL FROM \"ACTIVE\" INVENTORY AND WORKPLAN AND BATCH\"}\n```\n\nThis is a correct JSON. In a valid JSON, string values must be enclosed in double quotes, but they are also trimmed to remove any extra whitespace.\n```\n{\"answer\": \"IDENTIFY POOL FROM \"ACTIVE\" INVENTORY AND WORKPLAN AND BATCH\"}\n```\nshould be reformatted to:\n```\n{\"answer\": \"IDENTIFY POOL FROM \"ACTIVE\" INVENTORY AND WORKPLAN AND BATCH\"}\n```\nis still not valid JSON. A valid JSON should use double quotes instead of single quotes. Here is the corrected JSON:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"IDENTIFY POOL FROM \"\"ACTIVE\"\" INVENTORY AND WORKPLAN AND BATCH\"}\n```\n\nHowever, the most common use case of this agent reasoning does not use double quotes for this part, but this is what most people use for JSON formatting.\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"identify pool from \"active\" inventory and workplan and batch\"}\n```\n\nIf you need a validation schema for this, it will look like this:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"answer\": {\"default\": \"\", \"description\": \"The answer to the question.\", \"title\": \"Answer\", \"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\nBut most common JSON formatting does not use the schema. Here is the corrected JSON:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"IDENTIFY POOL FROM \"ACTIVE\" INVENTORY AND WORKPLAN AND BATCH\"}\n```"}
