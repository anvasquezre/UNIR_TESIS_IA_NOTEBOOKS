{"answer":"","unparsed_output":"Here is the corrected JSON:\n```json\n{\n    \"Venue\": {\n        \"Venue Owner Category\": \"PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED\",\n        \"Venue Code\": \"2493\"\n    },\n    \"fein_or_ssn\": \"Venue Owner Name: Kyosti Inc.\",\n    \"sponsorship_funds\": {\n        \"total\": \"$ 3,500.00\",\n        \"Special Events Fund\": \"$ 150.00 to offset costs for a minimum of 1 special events from jan. 1 - June 30, 2001.\",\n        \"Printed Materials Fund\": \"$ 350.00 to offset costs for the printing and shipping of custom flyers, as well as the purchases of local media, from Jan. 1 - Dec. 31, 2001.\",\n        \"Total Direct Payments\": {\n            \"March 31, 2001\": \"$ 750.00\",\n            \"June 30, 2001\": \"$ 750.00\",\n            \"September 30, 2001\": \"$ 750.00\",\n            \"December 31, 2001\": \"$ 750.00\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"extra_value_items\": {\n        \"Bar Essentials\": \"free distribution of branded items for use within the venue at discretion of KBA, as available\"\n    }\n    \"tobacco_license_feeds\": \"all state and local retail tobacco licensing fees for Venue (if Venue is currently without a license), plus assistance with tobacco licensing application procedures\"\n}\n```\n\nI fixed the following errors:\n1. The first-level key in the JSON object is \"Venue\" instead of \"fein_or_ssn\" \n2. \"Tobacco License Feeds\" was a second-level key, I moved it to the top-level of JSON, however the first key level before it should be renamed to fix the error\n3. Minor typo in \"Kyoti Inc.\""}
